                        web page when it overlaps other elements.The z-index property uses integer values, which can be
                        positive or negative values. The element with the highest z-index value will be at the
                        foreground, while the element with the lowest z-index value will be at the back.</td>

                    <td>Positioning in CSS provides designers and developers options for positioning HTML elements on a
                        web page. The CSS position can be set to static, relative, absolute or fixed. When the CSS
                        position has a value of fixed, it is set/pinned to a specific spot on a page. The fixed element
                        stays the same regardless of scrolling. The navigation bar is a great example of an element that
                        is often set to position:fixed;, enabling the user to scroll through the web page and still
                        access the navigation bar</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>absolute</td>
                    <td>The value absolute for the CSS property position enables an element to ignore sibling elements
                        and instead be positioned relative to its closest parent element that is positioned with
                        relative or absolute. The absolute value removes an element entirely from the document flow. By
                        using the positioning attributes top, left, bottom and right, an element can be positioned
                        anywhere as expected.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>relative</td>
                    <td>The value relative of the CSS position property enables an element to be positioned relative to
                        where it would have originally been on a web page. The offset properties can be used to
                        determine the actual position of the element relative to its original position. Without the
                        offset properties, this declaration will have no effect on its positioning, it will act as the
                        default value static of the position property.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>sticky</td>
                    <td>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative
                        to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including
                        table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not
                        affect the position of any other elements.

                        This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its
                        nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll,
                        auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.

                    <td>The CSS display property determines the type of render block for an element. The most common
                        values for this property are block, inline, and inline-block.

                        Block-level elements take up the full width of their container with line breaks before and
                        after, and can have their height and width manually adjusted.

                        Inline elements take up as little space as possible, flow horizontally, and cannot have their
                        width or height manually adjusted.

                        Inline-block elements can appear next to each other, and can have their width and height
                        manually adjusted.</td>

                    <td>The CSS float property determines how far left or how far right an element should float within
                        its parent element. The value left floats an element to the left side of its container and the
                        value right floats an element to the right side of its container. For the property float, the
                        width of the container must be specified or the element will assume the full width of its
                        containing element.</td>

                        The CSS clear property specifies how an element should behave when it bumps into another element
                        within the same containing element.The clear is usually used in combination with elements having
                        the CSS float property. This determines on which sides floating elements are allowed to float.
